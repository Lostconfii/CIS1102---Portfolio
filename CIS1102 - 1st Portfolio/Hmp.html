                  <h2>Concept of Number System</h2>

                <p>The concept of number systems refers to different ways of representing numbers using a set of symbols, such as decimal (base 10), binary (base 2), octal (base 8), and hexadecimal (base 16), each used in various computing and mathematical applications.</p>
                <p>,</p>
                <p><strong>What are the common number systems used in computing?</strong></p>
                <p>The common number systems used in computing are binary (base 2) for computer operations, decimal (base 10) for everyday counting, octal (base 8) in some programming contexts, and hexadecimal (base 16) for memory addressing and coding.</p>
                <p><strong>How do conversions between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal work?</strong></p>
                <p>Conversions between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal work by changing a number from one base to another using place values, grouping, or repeated division and multiplication.</p>
                <p><strong>Why is the binary system essential for computers?</strong></p>
                <p>The binary system is essential for computers because it represents data using only two states (0 and 1), which correspond to the off and on states of electronic circuits, making it reliable and efficient for processing and storing information.</p>

                  <h2>Basic Concepts and Definitions of Data and Database</h2>

                <p>Data refers to raw facts or figures that have no meaning on their own, while a database is an organized collection of data stored electronically, designed to be easily accessed, managed, and updated.</p>
                <p>,</p>
                <p><strong>What is the purpose of a database, and how is it structured?</strong></p>
                <p>A database is designed to store, organize, and manage large amounts of data efficiently, allowing easy retrieval, updating, and reporting. It is typically structured in tables,
                where each table consists of rows (records) representing individual entries and columns (fields) representing data attributes. Tables can be related to each other through keys to maintain data integrity and support complex queries.</p>
                <p><strong>How does data storage differ between traditional files and databases?</strong></p>
                <p>Traditional files store data separately without structure, while databases organize data in tables with relationships for faster access, easier updates, and better security.</p>
                <p><strong>What are the advantages of using databases?</strong></p>
                <p>Databases efficiently organize data, ensure accuracy, speed up retrieval, enhance security, reduce duplication, support backups, and allow multiple users to access information simultaneously.</p>

                  <h2>Basic Concepts of Computer Networks: Topology, Scope, Types, and Tools</h2>

                <p>Computer networks connect multiple devices to share data and resources. Key concepts include topology (the arrangement of network devices),
                scope (the coverage area, like LAN or WAN), types (such as wired or wireless networks), and tools (hardware and software used to build, manage, and secure networks).</p>
                <p>,</p>
                <p><strong>What are different network topologies, and where are they used?</strong></p>
                <p>Network topologies include bus (single cable), star (central hub), ring (closed loop), mesh (fully connected), tree (hierarchical), and hybrid (combination), each used based on network size, reliability, and management needs.</p>
                <p><strong>How do network types vary (e.g., LAN, WAN)?</strong></p>
                <p>Network types vary by coverage: PAN (personal devices), LAN (home or office), CAN (campus), MAN (city), and WAN (wide areas like the Internet), each serving different connectivity needs.</p>
                <p><strong>What tools are commonly used in networking?</strong></p>
                <p>Common networking tools include routers, switches, hubs, modems, cables, access points, firewalls, and network analyzers to connect, manage, and secure networks.</p>
